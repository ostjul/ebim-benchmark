  🚧 DRAFT SKELETON — NOT YET PUBLISHED. Tracking issue: #8 (Participant-grade README for launch).
  Purpose: a participant-facing guide skeleton. Verifiable sections are filled from existing
  repo docs + the competition page. Per-task run commands are EXTRACTED from repo sources and
  marked "(extracted from <file:line> — verify)" — each task owner verifies/corrects the command
  for the code they wrote. Task 3 now has a runnable preview; end-to-end verification remains tracked in #13.
  Prerequisites, repo structure, integration, and final assembly/placement
  (including whether this graduates to the top-level README.md) are @Ju6276's as steward.
  NO run command in this file was invented; anything not extractable is left as an owner-tagged
  <!-- @handle: question --> stub. Do not merge until the stubs are resolved.

# EBiM Benchmark — Participant Guide

> **🚧 Draft skeleton (issue #8).** This is the participant-facing quickstart. Sections below marked
> `(extracted from … — verify)` carry a command pulled from an existing repo file that the task owner
> still needs to confirm; sections with `<!-- @handle: … -->` comments are open questions for that owner.

## What this is

The **EBiM Benchmark** is a globally coordinated benchmark for real-world **embodied bimanual
manipulation**: an open simulation phase combined with cross-continent real-robot validation on
identical **Mobile FR3 Duo** platforms (dual Franka FR3 arms + Robotiq 2F-85 grippers on a
steer-drive mobile base).
<!-- Overview text extracted from https://ebim-benchmark.github.io/competition.html — @Ju6276 verify the one-line framing you want participants to see. -->

This repository is where you **develop and practice** against the competition tasks in simulation.
For the exact capability status of every task/engine before you build, see **[STATUS.md](../STATUS.md)**.
Full rules and official scoring live on the **[competition page](https://ebim-benchmark.github.io/competition.html#tasks)**.

## Competition tasks

<!-- Reused verbatim from the current stopgap table on `main` (README.md:5-13, PR #19). -->

| Task | Engines | Where in this repo | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task 1 — Cable Routing & Plugging | Isaac Sim, MuJoCo | [`task1_isaacsim/`](../task1_isaacsim/), [`task1_mujoco/`](../task1_mujoco/) | see [STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) |
| Task 2 — Deformable Material Handling (Thermal Pad Placement) | Isaac Sim (Genesis committed) | [`task2_isaacsim/`](../task2_isaacsim/), [`assets/task2_objects/`](../assets/task2_objects/), [`scripts/evaluation/task2/`](../scripts/evaluation/task2/) | see [STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) |

Full rules and official scoring are on the competition page:
<https://ebim-benchmark.github.io/competition.html#tasks> . The evaluation code in this repository is a
development facilitator; official scoring follows the rules published there.

## Prerequisites

Requirements differ per task and engine; each task's linked README below carries the authoritative,
task-specific setup. In general:

- **Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab tasks (Task 1 Isaac Sim, Task 2, Task 3)** — Linux host with a supported
  NVIDIA GPU; Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2; NVIDIA Container Toolkit; X11 for GUI; NVIDIA NGC
  access for `nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim` / `isaac-lab` images.
  <!-- (extracted from docs/developer_setup.md:9-14 — verify) -->
- **Task 1 MuJoCo** — Miniconda for native practice (the launcher bootstraps its own env); Docker
  Engine + Compose v2 for the scored evaluation. Scored runs need native Linux (WSL2 cannot reach the
  evidence camera's 25 fps). <!-- (extracted from task1_mujoco/README.md:97-113 — verify) -->

Note: Task 1 (Isaac Sim) uses a **Newton-enabled Isaac Lab overlay**, not the repo's
`docker/isaac-lab-2.3.2` profile — see its README for the container it needs.

<!-- @Ju6276: is there a single "get started" prerequisite path you want participants to land on first
     (e.g. "start with Task 1 MuJoCo — least setup"), or should prerequisites stay per-task as above?
     Also: any registration / competition-signup prerequisite that belongs here before the task setup? -->

## Per-task quickstart

> Each runnable block below starts from a command **extracted from a repo file**. The task owner confirms it is the right participant entry point
> and trims/expands as needed. Full setup for every task is in the task's own README, linked at the top
> of each block.

### Task 1 — Cable Routing & Plugging (Isaac Sim)

Full setup + run: **[`task1_isaacsim/README.md`](../task1_isaacsim/README.md)** (one-time asset download,
Newton-enabled Isaac Lab overlay, teleop device layer).

```bash
# Quick start from the repo root, after the one-time setup:
EMBODIMENT=fr3duo_mobile bash task1_isaacsim/scripts/run_isaaclab_newton_teleop.sh \
  --usd-path assets/Robotiq_2f_85_with_d405_mobile_fr3_duo_v0_2.usd \
  --controller-mode position --with-keyboard-teleop
```
<!-- (extracted from README.md:33-37; fuller variants at task1_isaacsim/README.md:194-224 — verify) -->
<!-- @QGSQ + @2houyuhang: confirm this is the participant entry command for Task 1 (Isaac Sim), and
     which variant to lead with — keyboard-base + browser-arms (no hardware) vs. the tested GELLO+pedal
     config. Point participants at the minimal path first. -->

### Task 1 — Cable Routing & Plugging (MuJoCo)

Full setup + run: **[`task1_mujoco/README.md`](../task1_mujoco/README.md)** (native practice vs. Docker
scored eval; input modes; controls; troubleshooting).

```bash
cd task1_mujoco
./start.sh              # native teleoperation practice (Windows: double-click start.bat)
./eval.sh sim           # scored ManipulationNet evaluation (Docker), terminal 1
./eval.sh client        # terminal 2: official mnet client
```
<!-- (extracted from README.md:50-55; step-by-step scored walkthrough at task1_mujoco/README.md:126-209 — verify) -->
<!-- @2houyuhang: confirm the two-terminal scored-eval sequence is the participant path, and whether the
     native `./start.sh` practice step should come first in this guide. -->

### Task 2 — Deformable Material Handling / Thermal Pad Placement (Isaac Sim)

Full setup + run: **[`task2_isaacsim/README.md`](../task2_isaacsim/README.md)** (prerequisites,
scenes, input devices, architecture); scoring is in
**[`scripts/evaluation/task2/README.md`](../scripts/evaluation/task2/README.md)**
(eval container lifecycle, IoU metric, artifacts).

```bash
# From the repo root, with the Isaac Sim 5.1.0 container running and the robot
# USD downloaded: launch the teleoperable room scene (publishes the eval-camera
# topics) — keyboard base + browser arms, no special hardware:
bash task2_isaacsim/scripts/run_isaacsim_teleop.sh \
  --scene room \
  --with-keyboard-teleop

# Drive the pad placement (see task2_isaacsim/README.md for GELLO + pedal), then
# score it — one-time setup, build + start the eval container, evaluate:
bash scripts/evaluation/task2/setup.sh
bash scripts/evaluation/task2/run.sh up
bash scripts/evaluation/task2/run.sh evaluate
```
<!-- (extracted from task2_isaacsim/README.md Quickstart + scripts/evaluation/task2/README.md:13-32) -->
<!-- Resolved on feature/task2_teleop: the teleop path between scene-launch and `run.sh evaluate`
     is task2_isaacsim/ (keyboard/browser or GELLO + foot pedal). -->


### Task 3 — Assisted Living & Feeding (Isaac Sim)

Full setup and controls: **[`task3_isaacsim/README.md`](../task3_isaacsim/README.md)**;
grading helpers: **[`scripts/evaluation/task3/README.md`](../scripts/evaluation/task3/README.md)**.

```bash
# From the repository root, after starting the shared Isaac Sim 5.1 container:
# Robotiq is the benchmark default; use `--gripper panda` for the current
# Franka-hand compatibility robot. Browser control needs no special hardware.
bash task3_isaacsim/scripts/run_isaacsim_teleop.sh \
  --gripper robotiq
```

Task 3 is a runnable preview: Table Setup → Feed → Bean Recovery → Clean Up.
Keyboard and browser control are available; GELLO/pedal hardware, force-limited
grasping, and a complete four-stage teleoperated run still require verification
([#13](https://github.com/EBiM-Benchmark/benchmark/issues/13)). Task 3 MuJoCo
remains in development ([#14](https://github.com/EBiM-Benchmark/benchmark/issues/14)).

## Local scoring

The evaluation code in this repository (Task 2 scoring, Task 3 grading helpers, and the vendored ManipulationNet
client) is a **development facilitator**; official scoring follows the official rules and scoring
published on the **[competition page](https://ebim-benchmark.github.io/competition.html#tasks)**.
<!-- Facilitator note condensed (near-verbatim) from STATUS.md:25 + README.md:13. -->
