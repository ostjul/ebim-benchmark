# Simulation Development Status

Last updated: 2026-08-05 — updated with each release; every checkmark is verifiable in this repository's history.

## Legend

Capabilities tracked per task/engine:

1. Scene assets complete
2. Robot asset in scene
3. Teleoperation
   - 3.1 keyboard: gripper
   - 3.2 keyboard: base
   - 3.3 GELLO: gripper
   - 3.4 VR: gripper
   - 3.5 foot pedal: base
   - 3.6 keyboard: arm lift
4. Grasping works within contact-force limits
5. Full task run completable via teleoperation
6. Baseline model
7. Real-world dataset (200 episodes, GELLO + keyboard)

✅ = verified working in the current release. This matrix covers what is built and verified; the competition page lists all committed engines per task (e.g., Genesis for Task 2), which may not yet appear here.

Note: evaluation code in this repository (including the Task 2 scorer, Task 3 grading helpers, and vendored ManipulationNet client) is a development facilitator; official scoring follows the official rules and scoring published on the competition page (https://ebim-benchmark.github.io/competition.html#tasks).

\* Task 3 MuJoCo: the environment landed in [`task3_mujoco/`](task3_mujoco/) — the 100- and 300-bean scenes compile with the robot and all four cameras present, so rows 1 and 2 are checked. Keyboard teleoperation, force-limited grasping, and a full four-stage run are **not** checked. The code implements keyboard teleop and contact-force-limited gripper closing, but upstream ships no automated tests and `teleop.py` requires an interactive display, so nothing headless exercises the controller; those rows stay unchecked until a maintainer drives the session at a display. Verified so far: model compilation, config loading, and the large-asset flow. Twenty-one visual assets are hosted outside git; see that README's fetch step. Tracked in [#14](https://github.com/EBiM-Benchmark/benchmark/issues/14).

Task 3's ROS/browser/GELLO plumbing supports selectable Robotiq and Panda gripper profiles through [`task3_isaacsim/`](task3_isaacsim/). GELLO and foot-pedal rows remain unverified until a device owner completes the hardware test.

## What can I develop against today?

Task 1 (MuJoCo) and Task 2 (Isaac Sim) are fully usable end-to-end; Task 2 teleoperation (keyboard/browser and GELLO + foot pedal on the mobile FR3 Duo) runs in plain Isaac Sim 5.1.0 via [`task2_isaacsim/`](task2_isaacsim/). Task 1 (Isaac Sim) is partially operational (GELLO/pedal teleoperation and grasping verified; end-to-end run pending). Task 3 now has a runnable Isaac Sim preview with direct keyboard control, ROS/browser helpers, selectable Robotiq/Panda robots, and deterministic grading helpers via [`task3_isaacsim/`](task3_isaacsim/); force-limited grasping, GELLO/pedal hardware, and the full four-stage teleoperated run remain unverified. Task 3 also has a MuJoCo environment in [`task3_mujoco/`](task3_mujoco/) that runs natively without Docker or ROS, driven by a single `config.json` — the scenes, robot, and cameras are in place, but its teleoperation has not been maintainer-verified yet, so develop against it knowing that. Baselines and the real-world dataset continue to release incrementally.
